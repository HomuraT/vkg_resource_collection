__Note: Why two different sets of queries for DB and OBDA modes:__ Queries 11 and 12 contain two fixed strings that vig can generate only when executed in OBDA mode, because it is the only mode recognizing fixed-domain columns. Therefore, the two strings were replaced with DB-specific values in the experiments for the DB mode.
